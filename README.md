# Evolving Threat Landscapes
This project investigates various cybersecurity forums to analyse the evolving threat landscape. The forums explored include publicly accessible platforms, dark web markets, and industry-specific forums where threat actors and security professionals discuss vulnerabilities, attack methods, and defensive strategies. After identifying emerging trends and threats from these forums, MITRE ATT&CK is employed to examine the techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries. The research focuses on specific adversary behaviours and attack vectors impacting organizations of various sizes, from mid-sized businesses to Fortune 500 companies. The project outlines both technical and procedural mitigations, with particular emphasis on defending against phishing, supply chain attacks, and other high-risk threat


### Types of Cybersecurity Forums:
-	Publicly Accessible Forums: Platforms like Reddit or specialized cybersecurity communities (e.g., BleepingComputer, Hack Forums) where threat intelligence and security news are frequently shared.
-	Dark Web and Deep Web Forums (VIA A VENDOR) : Underground marketplaces and forums such as Raid Forums (now defunct), or new dark web platforms where malicious actors share tactics, tools, and compromised data.
-	Industry-Specific Forums (VIA A VENDOR): Security-focused forums related to particular industries, like financial, healthcare, or manufacturing sectors, where threat actors target vulnerabilities or share attack methods relevant to those sectors.


### To ensure the trends and threats identified are relevant and actionable:
1.	Cross-Referencing Threat Intelligence Sources: Once a trend or potential threat is identified on a forum, it will be cross-referenced with reputable threat intelligence platforms such as Flashpoint, Recorded Future, or Digital Shadows to validate its credibility.
2.	Correlation with Industry Reports: Trends will also be compared against recent industry reports like those from Verizon’s Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), CrowdStrike’s Global Threat Report, or other sector-specific cybersecurity reports, ensuring alignment with known attacks affecting different industries.
3.	Threat Actor Profiling: Adversary behaviours will be profiled using MITRE ATT&CK, matching the identified TTPs against well-known adversaries and groups, particularly those that target specific sectors (e.g., FIN groups targeting financial services or APT groups targeting government organizations).
4.	Relevance to Target Organizations: The identified techniques will be assessed for their impact on different types of organizations. This will include an analysis of how trends affect specific industries (e.g., phishing attacks in the financial sector vs. supply chain attacks in the manufacturing sector).
